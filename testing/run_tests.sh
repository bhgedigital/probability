#     everything captured by "//tensorflow_probability/..." (this *doesn't* mean
#     "build the tests but don't run them" which is how it sounds)
#   --test_timeout -- comma separated values correspond to various test sizes
#     (short, moderate, long or eternal)
#   --test_tag_filters -- skip tests whose 'tags' arg (if present) includes any
#     of the comma-separated entries
#   --action_env -- specify environment vars to pass through to action
#     environment. (We need these in order to run inside a virtualenv.)
#     See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6648 and b/121259040.
